During my PhD, I've teached for 2 courses at Montpellier University in the Biology and Ecology department.

## Undergrade

I've teached for the course called *Quantification de l'Al√©a* which aims to teach inferential statistic and how to manage basic data. The scope of the course is to study theory behind statistical tests and then apply them using R. The students learn how to conduct a statistical analysis with analyzing the caveats of the test and all parameters.

Here is a list of Statistical Parametric and Non Parametric Test seen during the course:

- Student
- Shapiro
- Fisher
- Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney
- Chi-Square
- Pearson Correlation

## Master degree

I've teached for the course at the beginning of the degree to learn the basis from previous years that might have not been seen for some students coming from other universities.
