#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I'm a PhD student at Montpellier University working on the role of biotic and abiotic interaction on tropical fish diversification. Using recent observation data and molecular phylogeny, I search to explain how diversity is spread on Earth's surface and what are the drivers and origin. I build a mechanistic model using JULIA to enhance previous models and test hypothesis on the origin of fish diversity and its drivers.
